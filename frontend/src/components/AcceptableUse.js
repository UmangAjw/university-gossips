            uGossips is a place that empowers people to share and grow the
            world's knowledge. We believe if people don't feel safe they can't
            contribute to knowledge or listen to another person's point of view.
            The following rules help everyone on uGossips have a safe
            experience:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Be Nice, Be Respectful</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow uGossips's Be Nice, Be Respectful policy (“BNBR”), which
            includes the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Engage with Others in a Constructive Way</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Assume everyone on uGossips is here to make the platform a great
            resource with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and opinions. It is OK
            to disagree, but please be civil, respectful, and considerate to
            other posters.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>No Hate Speech</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            uGossips is a place for civil discourse and does not tolerate
            content that attacks or disparages an individual or group based on
            race, gender, religion, nationality, ethnicity, political group,
            sexual orientation or another similar characteristic. Any
            generalizations about these topics should be phrased as neutrally as
            possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>No Harassment and Bullying</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Abusive behavior directed towards private individuals is not
            allowed. Repeated and unwanted contact constitutes a form of
            harassment. Content should not make threats against others or
            advocate violence, including self-harm.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Respect the Rights of Others</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Identity and Deceptive Activity</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your uGossips profile should use accurate and truthful credentials
            and should follow our name policy. Do not use uGossips to
            impersonate another person, act as another entity without
            authorization, or create multiple accounts with the intention of
            violating uGossips's policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Intellectual Property and Personal Rights</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not post content that infringes any intellectual property or
            personal right of another party. Writing taken from another source
            should be properly attributed and block quoted.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Respect the uGossips Platform</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>No Spam</i>
          </p>
          <p>Do not use uGossips to post or attract spam.</p>

          <p>
            <i>No Malicious or Illegal Activity</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not contribute viruses, malware, and other malicious programs or
            engage in activity that harms or interferes with the operation of
            uGossips or seeks to circumvent security or authentication measures.
            Do not use uGossips to engage in unlawful activity or to promote
            illegal acts.
